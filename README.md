BSP for Topic development boards, like the Miami and its Florida carrier
boards.

This is an overlay intended for OpenEmbedded and/or Yocto.

# OpenEmbedded

Here's a quick script for OE:

```
mkdir my-zynq
cd my-zynq
git clone git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core oe-core
cd oe-core
git checkout 4e0fb630d3bb0250ece6e2071ae49b2601ae3e57
cd ..
git clone git://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded.git meta-oe
cd meta-oe
git checkout 9a67b079a7deff2d6e53df031b26304a71c4e0f8
cd ..
git clone git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake bitbake
cd bitbake
git checkout 2c778ad50aceaffb855baf5f4aa0fed98c880870
cd ..
git clone http://github.com/topic-embedded-products/meta-topic.git meta-topic

meta-topic/scripts/init-oe.sh

cd build

# Edit local.conf to match your setup.
vi conf/local.conf

# The default machine is "topic-miami-florida-gen-xc7z015", change it in the
# "profile" script or just export the MACHINE environment before building.

# Then build your first image and relax a bit:
. ./profile
nice bitbake my-image
````

Note that "my-image" was designed to be used with DISTRO=tiny. It
expects to run with busybox-mdev instead of udev.


# Yocto

For Yocto, clone this repository to a local directory, and add it to the
conf/bblayers.conf file. It should have a BBLAYERS that looks like this:
````
BBLAYERS ?= " \
  ${HOME}/poky/meta \
  ${HOME}/poky/meta-yocto \
  ${HOME}/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
  ${HOME}/poky/meta-oe/meta-oe \
  ${HOME}/poky/meta-topic \
  "
````

Change your MACHINE to, for example, "topic-miami-florida-gen-xc7z015" or
"topic-miami-florida-gen-xc7z030", depending on the board you have, and
bitbake core-image-minimal. See also the Yocto Quick start for more
information:
http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/1.6.1/yocto-project-qs/yocto-project-qs.html

A few recipes still require the "gitpkgv" class from meta-openembedded.
Include it by cloning git://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded.git and add
the path to its "meta-oe" subdirectory to the conf/bblayers.conf list.


# BOOT

The simplest way to boot the resulting image is to place it on an SD
card. The `scripts/partition-sd-card.sh` script formats an SD card so it
can be used directly. This needs to be done only once for a card.
The `install-to-sd...` scripts copy the required files to the card. You'll
have to run these scripts as root, as they require low-level access to
the SD card.

To boot a Miami-Florida board, insert the SD card into the slot, set the
jumpers on the miami to boot from SD (01010110) and switch on the power
supply.


# Additional information

In order to properly use the Zynq for anything useful, you will need to
build a bitstream image using the Xilinx tools.

This started as a fork of Ballister's OE environment for Zynq boards.

Support for Dyplo, which is not directly related to the hardware in this
layer, is provided by `meta-dyplo`:
https://github.com/topic-embedded-products/meta-dyplo

In future, this OpenEmbedded overlay is to be split up into several
components, as to separate the board support package for Topic Miami
boards and the tiny distro.
