Booting the Miami board using JTAG only.

(This is not complete yet, but contains many useful tips)

This applies to the Miami board with only the "Vice" debug board and the
Florida carrier boards. The system can boot and run Linux using only the
JTAG and a serial connection to a development PC.
This routine may work on many other boards too.

You will need:
- One or two USB cables.
- The "xmd" program from the Xilinx Vivado or XPS software suites.
- On Ubuntu, you may need the "libusb-driver" for the JTAG hardware.
- The results of an OpenEmbedded image build (kernel and ramdisk)
- The ps7_init.tcl script (created by Vivado or XPS)

Instructions:
-------------

To create the ps7_init.tcl script, open the Vivado project and configure
the PS7 for the Miami board. You won't need to generate a bitstream, so
you don't have to route anything in logic or otherwise.
Generate the design, and via File - Export - Hardware to SDK you can
write out the ps7_init files. The ps7_init.tcl is the one you need later.
(TODO: Link to reference design or board definition file or ...)

Set the jumpers on the Miami to boot from JTAG.
(TODO: Add the jumper settings here)
Connect the USB cable to the JTAG module on the board.
Connect another USB cable to the UART (if you have only one, you can do
this later on). Run a terminal program using 112500 baud, 8-bit,
no parity, no flow control.

Run the xmd program (you may need to "preload" the libusb-driver).
Enter the following commands (hint: place them in a script file and run
it using the "-tcl" commandline option):

connect arm hw
rst
source ps7_init.tcl
ps7_init
ps7_post_config
dow -data u-boot.bin 0x4000000
dow -data devicetree.dtb 0x2A00000
dow -data uImage 0x3000000
con 0x4000000

For the first attempt, omit the devicetree and kernel, and see if u-boot
starts up.
You can find the binaries in the OE build directory (see README).
